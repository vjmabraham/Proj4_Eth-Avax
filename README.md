## DEGEN Token
This project is a requirement for the ETH + AVAX course in metacrafters. This demonstrates the capabilities of an ERC20 token and its practical use in a game setting. This serves as an intermediate requirement for learning ETH and AVAX.

## Description
This program is a contract in Solidity, a programming program language used for developing smart contracts in Ethereum. The token is create for a game so that the players can use the token as a currency. The contract has multiple function that are stated below.

### Functions:
* A mint functions to mint the tokens for the one who deployed the contract.
* A transferToken function to transfer tokens to another user.
* A redeemItem function to redeem items for tokens.
* A checkBalance function to check the user's balance.
* A burn function to burn tokens.
* A viewInventory function to see your character's inventory.

## Deployment to Testnet

* I deployed the contract in the Fuji Test Network. After deployment, I used [Snowtrace](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/) to check the state of my contract.

## Compiling and Deploying

* To compile and deploy the program, I used hardhat to compile and deploy it to the fuji test network.
* After compiling and deploying, I used Remix IDE to interact with the functions of the contract.
